# Orbital Period and Orbital Radius: Kepler's Third Law

## Introduction

The relationship between the square of the orbital period and the cube of the orbital radius, known as Kepler's Third Law, is a cornerstone of celestial mechanics. This law allows us to understand and predict the motions of celestial bodies under gravitational influence.

## Derivation for Circular Orbits

Consider an object of mass *m* orbiting a central body of mass *M* in a circular orbit of radius *r*. The gravitational force provides the centripetal force:

* Gravitational force: $$F_{gravity} = G \frac{Mm}{r^2}$$
* Centripetal force: $$F_{centripetal} = \frac{mv^2}{r}$$

Equating these forces:

$$G \frac{Mm}{r^2} = \frac{mv^2}{r}$$

Simplifying:

$$v^2 = \frac{GM}{r}$$

The orbital velocity *v* is related to the orbital period *T* by:

$$v = \frac{2\pi r}{T}$$

Substituting *v*:

$$\left(\frac{2\pi r}{T}\right)^2 = \frac{GM}{r}$$

Rearranging:

$$T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2}{GM} r^3$$

This shows that $$T^2$$ is proportional to $$r^3$$.

## Implications for Astronomy

* **Calculating Planetary Masses:** By measuring *T* and *r*, we can determine *M*.
* **Determining Distances:** If *M* is known, we can calculate *r* from *T*.
* **Understanding Planetary Systems:** This law helps analyze the dynamics of celestial systems.

## Real-World Examples

* **Moon's Orbit:** The Moon's orbital period and distance from Earth confirm this law.
* **Solar System:** Planets in our solar system follow this law.
