    "## üéØ Objective\n",
    "This notebook investigates the relationship between orbital period and radius through Kepler‚Äôs Third Law for circular orbits. It includes a derivation, computational simulation, and analysis of real-world astronomical data. \n",

    "For a body in a circular orbit, the gravitational force balances the centripetal force required for circular motion:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Gravitational Force**: $F_g = \\frac{G M m}{r^2}$\n",
    "- **Centripetal Force**: $F_c = \\frac{m v^2}{r}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Equating these forces:  \n",
    "$$ \\frac{G M m}{r^2} = \\frac{m v^2}{r} $$  \n",
    "Cancel $m$ (mass of the orbiting body) and simplify:  \n",
    "$$ v^2 = \\frac{G M}{r} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The orbital velocity is $v = \\frac{2\\pi r}{T}$, where $T$ is the orbital period. Substituting:  \n",
    "$$ \\left(\\frac{2\\pi r}{T}\\right)^2 = \\frac{G M}{r} $$  \n",
    "$$ \\frac{4\\pi^2 r^2}{T^2} = \\frac{G M}{r} $$  \n",
    "Rearrange by multiplying both sides by $T^2$ and dividing by $r$:  \n",
    "$$ T^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{G M} r^3 $$  \n",
    "\n",
    "This yields $T^2 \\propto r^3$, demonstrating that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the orbital radius, a cornerstone of Kepler‚Äôs Third Law.\n",

    "## üåç Astronomical Significance\n",
    "Kepler‚Äôs Third Law has profound implications:\n",
    "1. **Mass Determination**: Using $T$ and $r$, the central body‚Äôs mass $M$ can be calculated (e.g., Earth‚Äôs mass from the Moon‚Äôs orbit).\n",
    "2. **Distance Measurement**: Orbital periods of planets provide their distances from the Sun.\n",
    "3. **Orbital Engineering**: This relationship informs the design of satellite trajectories, such as those for navigation systems.\n",

    "## üìä Computational Analysis\n",
    "This section implements a simulation to verify Kepler‚Äôs Third Law using real-world data and visualizations.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Orbital Data\n",
    "This step presents the orbital parameters for the Moon and select Solar System planets, including their central masses, orbital radii, and periods. The Moon orbits Earth, while Earth, Mars, and Jupiter orbit the Sun, providing a range of scales to test Kepler‚Äôs Third Law. The data will serve as the foundation for verifying the $T^2 \\propto r^3$ relationship in subsequent steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Circular Orbit Visualization üé¨\n",
    "To illustrate the dynamics of a circular orbit, an animated simulation of the Moon‚Äôs orbit around Earth is generated. The Moon‚Äôs orbital radius of 384,400 km is scaled for visualization, with Earth positioned at the origin. This animation highlights the uniform motion characteristic of a circular orbit, providing a visual representation of the period $T$ and radius $r$ used in Kepler‚Äôs Third Law.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: $T^2$ vs $r^3$ Verification\n",
    "A graphical representation confirms the $T^2 \\propto r^3$ relationship by plotting $T^2$ against $r^3$ for the Moon and planets. This visualization validates Kepler‚Äôs Third Law across different orbital scales, from the Moon‚Äôs orbit araound Earth to Jupiter‚Äôs orbit around the Sun.\n",

    "## üå† Extension to Elliptical Orbits\n",
    "For elliptical orbits, Kepler‚Äôs Third Law applies with $r$ representing the semi-major axis. This generalization extends its utility to diverse celestial phenomena, including comets and exoplanets.\n",
    "\n",
