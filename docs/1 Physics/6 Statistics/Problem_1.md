## 🎯 Motivation

The **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)** states that as the sample size $n$ increases, the sampling distribution of the sample mean $\bar{x}$ becomes approximately normal, regardless of the shape of the population distribution — provided the population has finite variance.

This simulation demonstrates CLT using:
- **Uniform Distribution**
- **Exponential Distribution**
- **Binomial Distribution**

---

## 🧪 Simulation Procedure

For each distribution:
1. Generate a large synthetic **population**.
2. For various sample sizes ($n = 5, 10, 30, 50$):
   - Take multiple random samples.
   - Compute the **sample means**.
   - Plot a histogram of the sample means to visualize the **sampling distribution**.

---

## 🔄 Sample Sizes and Repetitions

- Sample sizes: $n = 5$, $10$, $30$, $50$
- Repetitions per sample size: $1000$
- Population size: $100000$

---

## 📈 Visual Results

The histograms below demonstrate how the sampling distributions **approach normality** as $n$ increases — even when the population distribution is skewed or discrete.

This reinforces the power and generality of the CLT.

## 🌍 Real-World Applications

- 📏 Estimating population means in surveys and experiments  
- 🏭 Quality control in industrial production  
- 📊 Risk modeling and forecasting in finance  
- 🧠 Hypothesis testing and confidence intervals in statistics

## 🧠 Key Insight

> The Central Limit Theorem makes normal distribution the foundation of statistical inference — even when the population isn’t normal.
